# Data Engineering Portfolio: Little Lemon Operational Warehouse
By Monica Venzor | Biotechnology & Data Engineering
This repository showcases the end-to-end design and implementation of a Data Warehouse for operational management. While the case study is based on the food industry (Little Lemon), the architecture is built following principles of scalability, data integrity, and governance—skills that are critical in highly regulated industrial environments.

# 🏗️ Architecture & Technical Capabilities
The project demonstrates a complete data engineering workflow:

1. Data Modeling & SQL Development
  Relational Design: Implementation of a robust schema (Star Schema/Normalized) to ensure data consistency and reduce redundancy.
  Server-Side Logic: Development of Stored Procedures to automate critical business processes (bookings, cancellations, and sales reporting), optimizing performance by keeping logic close to the data.
  Data Quality & Governance: Implementation of constraints and validation rules to ensure data remains reliable and "audit-ready"—a direct application of scientific rigor to data management.

3. Integration & Automation (Python)
  DB-API Connectivity: Using the mysql-connector-python to establish secure connections for data extraction.
  Programmatic Data Handling: Executing complex queries and procedures through Python to bridge the gap between raw storage and analytical insights.

3. Business Intelligence (Tableau)
  KPI Visualization: Transformation of raw data into actionable insights through interactive dashboards, focusing on sales trends, profitability, and operational efficiency.

# 📂 Repository Structure
database/: Contains the EER (Entity-Relationship) models, schema creation scripts, and optimized Stored Procedures.

python/: Integration notebooks demonstrating the ability to handle data programmatically.

tableau/: Visual analysis layer for business result interpretation.

# 🧪 The "Bio-Data" Advantage
Coming from a Biotechnology background, my approach to data is rooted in Compliance and Traceability.

"I apply scientific rigor to data validation, ensuring that every record is consistent and traceable. This mindset is essential in industries where data integrity isn't just a technical requirement, but a regulatory necessity."

# ✅ Skills Demonstrated
Languages: SQL (MySQL), Python.

Tools: MySQL Workbench, Tableau, Jupyter Notebooks.

Core Concepts: EER Modeling, Stored Procedures, Data Integrity, ETL Fundamentals.
